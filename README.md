# AI-Assignment-Prolog
This is my submission for my Artificial Intelligence module Prolog assignment at the University of Lincoln.

The assignment was to create a Prolog program that when given a knowledge base of information about the world cup.
The knowledge base contained a number of teams, and the rounds and games they played in. The program must answer queries 
by the user about which teams did or had the potential to play each other and at what round.
